        Python library for consuming OpenStack sevice-types-authority data
        
        The `OpenStack Service Types Authority`_ contains information about official
        OpenStack services and their historical ``service-type`` aliases.
        
        The data is in JSON and the latest data should always be used. This simple
        library exists to allow for easy consumption of the data, along with a built-in
        version of the data to use in case network access is for some reason not
        possible and local caching of the fetched data.
